<p>So easy, saw Paperwhite bulbs at Walmart for 4.97 for 4 They are extremely fragrant, too much so for some people.i have noted that while the scent can be overpowering when the flowers first open, the fragrance fades a bit in a day or two. Yet, i have a section of yard that i�m trying to naturalize with paperwhite, inbal, ziva, etc. I cleaned the kitchen tile and the hardwood floors thinking that was where the smell was coming from until my husband figured out it was the plant. Set the bulbs in a warm, sunny spot, water regularly, and they will flower in a month or so. I don’t know about you but once christmas is over i feel a bit sad and i start craving flowers and signs of spring. Paperwhite in indoors bouquets simply stink to me, cant stand the smell.</p>
