<p>All this time, our loyal cop has never doubted that her husband is the good man she knows him to be. Okay, episode 5 of flower of evil cements it for me.i love this drama. Flower of evil, despite its initial primer as a thriller, was a psychological drama about healing and love. This show was my guilty pleasure, who knows what will take that spot next. It’s a race against time and each other to solve an old mystery that’s made its way into the present, with more than just their lives on the line.</p>

But he’s far from perfect, and he’s still haunted by ghosts from his past that could resurface at any time. Do not read if you don’t want to know. Money flower episode 24 (final) the cook, go eun a, finds jung mal ran (lee mi sook) in the kitchen next to a tray containing champagne and two glasses. He begs her to open her eyes. :(i knew that everyone deserved to cry because in my opinion, it was being tagged as suspenseful couple so people might understand how evil flowers as saw as a title referred or discovered them. Sang pil learns that oh ju won’t be giving the testimony leaves the trial to jae yi and goes to find oh ju.</p>
