<p>The Meaning of Flowers by Urban Botanicals Flower Be sure to stick to white carnations with your flower delivery instead as they represent pure love and sweetness. Since the ancient greeks first started leaving asphodel on the graves of their departed loved ones, there has been a continuous record of funeral flowers you can draw on. For example, red carnations represent romantic love and yellow symbolize rejection. This comes from the greek language. Extreme betrayal, a broken heart, infidelity, jealousy pink: Every flower color from a deep red to a bright yellow offers a rich and meaningful story.</p>

<p>Summer color at Starlight Ridge (With images) Flowers The symbolism of flower colors is steeped in tradition. A gift of asphodel carries the unnerving message my regrets follow you into the grave, which might cause the recipient to look twice the next time she crosses the street. Through breeding programs, the flower of death evolved to be perhaps better known as african marigold and french marigold, annuals grown in. Akin to this, the yellow rose also emanates warmth, affection and joy. Some carnations make excellent gifts, but yellow ones should be avoided. Marigolds generally mean happiness, except in mexico where it means death.</p>
