<p>Pin on Herbal Flowering time &amp; yield size. Topping or fimming is highly recommended. Additionally, some purebred sativas have been developed to have faster flowering.

<p>Pin on Cannabis Cures Strain Guide for Medical Marijuana Because sativa plants originate from places that have really long summer periods they take. Otherwise, it’s best to grow it indoors during the summertime. If you wish to grow your cannabis plant indoors, the outdoor sativa flowering time stage shall begin when the grow lights have been changed to 12 hours of light with 12 hours of darkness each day (12/12). Sativa stem is from regions near the equator, where the length of the day rarely changes regardless of what time of year it happens to be. Flowering is the growth stage when a healthy weed plant begins to produce resinous buds. Growing sativa outdoors is best if you live outdoors in a tropical or subtropical climate.</p>

<p>Pin on Strains Flowering is the stage of a grow cycle when a plant begins to produce buds. In layman’s term, it means that the plants produced from pure cannabis indica strain will give a heavy, stony, sleepy tiresome type of stone in the user. This is even faster than autoflowering plants that are usually around ten weeks. Comparatively, sativa has long maturity period, longer than that of the indica. Hybrids are a blend of sativa and indica cannabis strains. They will usually need between 60 and 90 days to finish blooming.</p>
