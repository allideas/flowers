<p>Last week, i tried flower with the highest thc i’ve ever seen: A mostly indica strain deriving from chemdawg og and gsc, the toad offers a euphoric high pretty immediately, then settles into a body relaxation, according to tyson ranch. This herb’s thc content reaches 28 percent max. Examples are the toad, sold by tyson ranch and tested at 37% thc, and brownie scout, developed by an illinois cultivator and tested at 37.5%. Psychog is a hybrid strain that is mostly limited to west coast tokers at the moment.</p>
