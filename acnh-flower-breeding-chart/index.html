<p>Everything You Need To Know About ACNH Flower Breeding The following flower breeding patterns are optimal for producing hybrids and new offspring. If a flower of the same species, but another color, is planted nearby, they can breed and create a new color. That pattern looks like an �x,� with a flower in the center and flowers placed around it diagonally, and here is an image that illustrates how to layout flowers for crossbreeding in acnh: Below are all the key breeding combinations (via paleh�s advanced flower genetics guide and our own testing) for every species and color of flower in new. How to create hybrid flowers. See the images below to see which color combinations are possible for each flower.</p>
