<p>Enjoy our new Paper Flower Wall PaperFlowerWall  From wedding backdrops, baby or bridal showers, and themed parties to interior home, school and office design, giant paper flowers can add the perfect touch of playful or sophisticated decoration to any setting. This design is straight out of wonderland. Hot glue gun and glue sticks (or tacky glue if you don’t have a glue gun) I design all of my paper flowers from real flowers — i find the actual flower (or a photo of it if its out of season), photograph it, scan it, and trace its petals and leaves carefully. The stuffed flowers give the whole piece a cool sculptural feel even though its simply paint on paper. Truly giant paper peony blossom.</p>
