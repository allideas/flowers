<p>HARNOOR KAUR OF GRADE5 BAGGED GOLD MEDAL AT STATE LEVEL Started in the 1970s, chipko movement got its name from the way people embraced the trees to protect them from being cut. The chipko movement was the result of hundreds of decentralised and locally autonomous initiatives. The hindi word chipko means “to hug” or “to cling to” and reflects the demonstrators’ primary tactic of embracing the trees to impede the loggers. Today, �chipko� has become a famous public. This was the strongest form of resistance against rampant cutting of trees, where people asserted their rights over. The main demand of the people in these protests was that the benefits of the forests (especially the right to fodder) should go to local people.</p>
