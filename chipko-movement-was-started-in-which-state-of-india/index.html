<p>Kerala floods At least 324 dead as rescue teams take to Sunderlal bahuguna (born 9 january 1927) is a noted garhwali environmentalist and chipko movement leader. The movement got its name due to peoples’ action of hugging trees in order to prevent them from being chopped. Amrita devi, a village woman came along with 84 villagers to protect trees from felling on the order of the king. “chipko” in hindi means to cling, reflecting the protesters main technique of throwing their arms around the tree trunks designated to be cut, and refusing to move. However, not many people know that the original chipko andolan dates back to the 18th century and was started by rajasthan’s bishnoi community. Today is the 45th anniversary of the andolan.</p>

The chipko movement, which has now spread from one end of the himalayas in kashmir to the other in arunachal pradesh, is endeavouring to alter the government�s forest policy by insisting on maintenance of the traditional status quo in the himalayan and other forest regions of india. In september 1983, men, women and children of salkani hugged the trees in kalase forest. That time, the chipko movement led by amrita devi. One of the strongest movements to conserve forests in india. The movement got this name as in hindi “chipko” means “to hug”.</p>

The original ’chipko movement’ was started around 260 years back in the early part of the 18 th century in rajasthan by this community. Chipko movement is associated with uttarakhand state. In this sense, there is resistance to change and to an opening. Women also played a significant role in this movement, and during this time many slogans became famous and became part of the movement. The incident has been etched in the annals of history for the sacrifice of a group of villagers, who led by a lady named amrita devi, laid down their lives while protecting trees from being felled on the orders of then king of jodhpur.</p>
