<p>National Rhododendron Garden, Olinda, Victoria, Australia Azaleas are relatively easy to grow and long lived if given reasonable care. Flowers tend to become brown and mushy and hang on the bush. Collect up diseased flowers and dispose of them into the garbage bin (do not compost). Sizes range from 0.5m to 4m tall, depending on the variety. Bring the outdoors inside with a houseplant! Or, conversely, if you have lost any nearby trees or had a tree removed or limbed up, your azaleas will be getting more sun than they used to.</p>
