<p>As a practical matter, i live in a very restrictive hoa (not for much longer though, hooray!) and my small antennas escape notice. I have a dualband kenwood tmv71 and would like to match an antenna for the patio. Few days ago my gp antenna broke. The main category is antennas for 2 meters band that is about antenna projects for 144 mhz. Here is a link to his webpage with instructions for making several of his designs.</p>

Experimental dual band high gain flower pot antenna this experimental version is an extension of the basic half wave flower pot antenna. It�s only the hf antenna i�m worried about, which i take down when not operating. This gives us a 2m aerial on a wire. It’s compact, light, economical and doesn’t need any radial. Its a good sunday morning project using minimal tools and materials.</p>

I was surprised how well it worked and a few others tried it and found it worked very well. I think about 1/2 lambda. A few years ago a made one of vk2zoi�s dual band flowerpot antennas.

This resulted in an antenna with swr of about 1.0 on 146.52 mhz simplex, and 2.0 on 144 and 148 mhz. In this clip i show you my antenna built using the flowerpot designs as found online. To construct the antenna, first select a suitable length of grey 25mm conduit (as a minimum 1m but if you make it longer, you will have more room below the coil to attach to your antenna support).</p>

<p>VHF Loop By N6VOA Antennas, Ham radio, Radio If you would like to repeat my experiment you will first need a big plastic flower pot (around 70cm high, 60 top diameter and 30 cm base diameter). This gives us a 2m aerial on a wire. The basic half wave version of the flower pot antenna can be readily modified to dual band the antenna for operation on a band that is the (approximate) third harmonic of the fundamental resonance. The main category is antennas for 2 meters band that is about antenna projects for 144 mhz. This resulted in an antenna with swr of about 1.0 on 146.52 mhz simplex, and 2.0 on 144 and 148 mhz.

This resulted in an antenna with swr of about 1.0 on 146.52 mhz simplex, and 2.0 on 144 and 148 mhz. The wx made fine tuning very brief, but long enough to get the swr to an acceptable 1.4:1. Other suggestions were made at the time included making a fake patio umbrella but the name “flower pot” has stuck for the last 14 or so years.</p>

<p>Pin on N6VOA / UTOC I think about 1/2 lambda. The flowerpot works well as a scanner antenna for vhf and uhf listening. To construct the antenna, first select a suitable length of grey 25mm conduit (as a minimum 1m but if you make it longer, you will have more room below the coil to attach to your antenna support). I was thinking of either doing a diamond mobile antenna with a mag mount on some type of metal table. Here is a very handy aerial for permanent and field day installations.

Thanks again to john for sharing his hard work in refining the antenna into such a cheap, easy to build and reproduce, and easy to hide design.

This easily reproducible design from vk2zoi can be made quickly and performs well. This resulted in an antenna with swr of about 1.0 on 146.52 mhz simplex, and 2.0 on 144 and 148 mhz.

<p>ADSB Virtual Radar rtl2832 rtl1090 i6ibe antenna 1090 Mhz To construct the antenna, first select a suitable length of grey 25mm conduit (as a minimum 1m but if you make it longer, you will have more room below the coil to attach to your antenna support). Funk radio hf radio basic electrical wiring battery charger circuit dipole antenna qrp. They are end fed coaxial dipoles with an interesting design to make them dual. I will mostly use it on 2m band because the 70cm is not very active here. Wed jun 2, 2004 8:38 am subject: My balcony is 2.5x2m but i will place the antenna outside of the balcony.</p>

<p>Pin on Antenna My balcony is 2.5x2m but i will place the antenna outside of the balcony. And now i dont have any antennas for 2m/70cm. Operation on the third harmonic is achieved by using a sleeve technique so as to form quarter wave phasing sections (at the higher frequency) to end feed two. Or, a diamond x50 or x30 base antenna mounted to a mast hidden in a flower pot. Its a good sunday morning project using minimal tools and materials. I live in apartment and i want to make a small antenna.</p>

<p>2m Slim Jim Antenna for SOTA 4 Jun 2013 Ham radio I have a dualband kenwood tmv71 and would like to match an antenna for the patio. By all reports, it’s a beauty. To construct the antenna, first select a suitable length of grey 25mm conduit (as a minimum 1m but if you make it longer, you will have more room below the coil to attach to your antenna support). A few years ago a made one of vk2zoi�s dual band flowerpot antennas. About the flower pot antenna the resource is currently listed in dxzone.com in 4 categories. It can be raised by pulling from the top, typically with a rope over a high tree branche, or can be mounted on a squid pole, passing the squid pole inside the.</p>

<p>Пин на доске N6VOA / UTOC I have a dualband kenwood tmv71 and would like to match an antenna for the patio. Operation on the third harmonic is achieved by using a sleeve technique so as to form quarter wave phasing sections (at the higher frequency) to end feed two. The wx made fine tuning very brief, but long enough to get the swr to an acceptable 1.4:1. I think about 1/2 lambda. They are end fed coaxial dipoles with an interesting design to make them dual. It’s compact, light, economical and doesn’t need any radial.</p>
