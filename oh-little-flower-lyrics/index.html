Therese, help me to always believe as you did, in god�s great love for me, You�re my little flower blooming in the night only for an hour the northern lights my casablanca sweetheart nectar so divine baby you�re the best part of my life what can i do what can i say to convince you to stay all i see are tulips and i�m a hummingbird heavenly ambrosia in every curve honey dripping over my imagination the fragrance Lemon tree very pretty and the lemon flower is sweet but the fruit of the poor lemon is impossible to eat. Lyrics from animelyrics.com oh, field flower that has bloomed, ah, somehow, please tell me: Oh, little child, see how the flower you pluck bleeds on the iron ground bend down, your ears may catch its voice a passionless, low sobbing sound oh, man, put up your sword and see the brother that you did to death there is no hatred in his eye no curses crackle in his breath</p>

Oh little sister, you know i miss you / just like i always do this time of year / nothing’s changed with mama’s raving / she’s convinced you still need saving / that.</p>
