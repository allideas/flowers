The vibrant aster is the birth flower of september. The narcissus is not to be confused with the daffodil, as despite also being a type of narcissus, the daffodil is, in fact, march’s birth flower. The flower is named after american diplomat and physician joel roberts poinsett, who took a vital role in bringing the plants from mexico to north america. Every flower has a meaning, and can convey certain emotions, thoughts, or moods to the recipient. This beautifully bold bloom is symbolic of good wishes, faithfulness, and respect.</p>
